### Notes
Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
- I ran into a few obstacles while getting things to run, but they were similar to many issues I faced with other programming tools such as applications or modules not installing properly. I had to go through some hurdles to use cocoapods correctly.
- Coding in Swift with Xcode and MacOS is still new to me so there are some things I need to get used to like dealing with viewcontrollers and understanding how everything connects with each other.
